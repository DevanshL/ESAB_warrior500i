5 OPERATION

#### 5.5 Fan control

The power source has a time control that means that the fans continue to run for 4 minutes after
welding has stopped. The fans start again when welding restarts.

#### 5.6 Usage of cooling unit

**ELP (ESAB Logic Pump)**

The cooling unit is equipped with detection system called ELP (ESAB Logic Pump), which checks that
the coolant hoses are connected. When connecting a liquid cooled torch, cooling starts.

**NOTE!**
The cooling unit starts as soon as the ELP is activated!

For liquid cooled torches, the cooling unit will start only if the torch cooling hoses are
connected to the wire feeder.

When the cooling hoses are disconnected from the wire feeder, the cooling stops immediately.

**NOTE!**
The cooling unit will be applicable only for MIG/MAG welding.

The power source automatically detects the need of cooling unit based on welding applications and
operates the cooling unit accordingly.

When liquid cooled torch is connected, if the coolant temperature exceeds 45 °C, the cooler fan and
pump will start even if there is no welding operation.

##### 5.6.1 Operation of cooling unit after welding

If the coolant temperature is below 55 °C, the cooler fan and pump will continue to run for three
minutes and then stop.

If the coolant temperature is at 65 °C or above, the cooler fan and pump will continue to run for seven
minutes and then stop.

In a long weld, if the coolant temperature has not decreased to 55 °C within seven minutes, the cooler
fan and pump will continue to run for another three minutes and then stop.

#### 5.7 Cooling unit connection

For trouble free operation, it is recommended that the height from the cooling unit to the liquid-cooled
torch is 25 m or less.

#### 5.8 Cooling unit pressure controller

The pump has an enclosed pressure relief valve. The valve opens gradually when the pressure is too
high. This can occur if a hose is folded, which causes the flow to fail or stop.

The indicator is lit in green when it is connected.|
||VRD (Voltage Reducing Device) The VRD function ensures that the open-circuit voltage does not exceed 35 V when welding is not being carried out. The VRD function must be activated by a qualified service technician, by means of Edge ESAT (ESAB Software Administration Tool, a kit for technical service including a software to manage settings, update of software etc.). The VRD function is blocked when the system senses that welding has started. When VRD function is active, the indicator is lit in green.|
||TRUEARC compensate To achieve a good welding result, the arc voltage is a crucial factor. In MIG/MAG welding, the power source is prepared to sense the arc voltage in the wire feeder. Prerequisite for this functionality is that an ESAB wire feeder and an ESAB interconnection cable is used. In compensation mode, when the torch is triggered on the workpiece (avoid wire contact), it measures the inductance and resistance to compensate for the voltage drop in the interconnection cable, torch and return cable. The indicator is lit in yellow when compensation is required and it blinks during the compensation process. If the compensation process is a success, the indicator is lit in green.|
||Warning/Error • Warning The indicator is lit in yellow and displays an "Err" message. If warning occurs, completion of ongoing weld is possible, but start of a new weld is prevented as long as the warning remains. • Error The indicator is lit in red and displays an "Err" message. The ongoing welding is stopped as long as the error remains.|
||Lock Green - This indicates when the system has limited access or Job limits are active. Red - This indicates the system is locked, and to be able to use the system, it is required to unlock. Red (blink) - This indicates when the user is trying to access the restricted features.|

11 CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION

### 11 CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION

**WARNING!**
Calibration and validation should be performed by a trained service technician, possessing
sufficient training in welding and measurement technology. The technician should have
knowledge of hazards that may occur during welding and measurement and should take
necessary protective actions!

#### 11.1 Measurement methods and tolerances

When calibrating and validating, the reference measuring instrument must use the same measuring
method in the DC range (averaging and rectification of the measured values). A number of
measurement methods are used for reference instruments, e.g. TRMS (True Root Mean Square),
RMS (Root-Mean-Square) and rectified arithmetic mean. Warrior Edge 500 DX uses the rectified
arithmetic mean value and should therefore be calibrated against a reference instrument using the
rectified arithmetic mean value.

In the field application it will occur that a measuring device and a Warrior Edge 500 DX may display
different values even though both systems are validated and calibrated. This is due to the
measurement tolerances and the method of measurement of the two measurement systems. This can
result in a total deviation up to the sum of both measurement tolerances. If the measurement method
differ (TRMS, RMS or rectified arithmetic mean), significantly larger deviations are to be expected!

The ESAB Warrior Edge 500 DX welding power source presents the measured value in rectified
arithmetic mean and should therefore not show any significant differences compared to other ESAB
welding equipment, due to the measurement method.

#### 11.2 Requirements, specifications and standards

Warrior Edge 500 DX is designed to meet the accuracy for indication and meters required by IEC/EN
60974-14, by definition Standard grade.

**Calibration accuracies of displayed value**

Arc voltage **±1.5 V (Umin–U2) under load, resolution 0.25 V (Theoretical measuring range in a**
Warrior Edge 500 DX system is 0.25–199 V.)

Welding current ±2.5% of I2 max according to rating plate of the unit under test, resolution 1 A. The

measuring range is specified by the rating plate on the used Warrior Edge 500 DX
welding power source.

**Recommended method and applicable standard**
ESAB recommend calibration and validation to be executed according to IEC/EN 60974-14 (unless
another way of execution is communicated from ESAB).
